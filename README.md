# Client Time Estimate

Hello Clarity,

Reading the instructions it would make more sense to me to use the code snippets from the two "bootsnipp" links rather than the "getbootstrap" example, but both would satisfy the needs so just checking in to clarify which I should use. Also, as it happens there's no provided list of products, so given that we'll be using dummy data when we link up the functionality. Do you have an existing product list you would prefer we connect to or a payment technology like stripe you'd like the shopping cart to connect to?  As it stands, using dummy data this job will take us 2 billable hours. Please let me know if you will be changing anything so I can give an accurate quote and we can fulfil your needs as best as possible! 

Thanks,

Tyrell
