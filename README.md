# Client Time Estimate

Reading the instructions it would make more sense to use the code snippets for the two "bootsnipp" links rather than the "getbootstrap example", but both would satisfy the needs so just checking in to clarify which I should use. (Question I actually have before starting) Also, as it happens there's no provided list of products, so given that we'll be using dummy data when we link up the functionality. Do you have an existing product list you would prefer we connect to or a payment technology like stripe you'd like the shopping cart to connect to?  As it stands, using dummy data this job will take us 2 billable hours. Please let me know so I can give an accurate quote and we can fulfil your needs as best as possible! (Additional questions I would ask the client but considering this is hypothetical I should probably use dummy data)

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
